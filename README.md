# Bug Tracker
This project is about designing and developing a bug tracker tool for software engineers. The goal is for users to be able to enter, update and monitor incidents and bugs. A live demo will be hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).  
The program is created for educational use only and is still under development.
